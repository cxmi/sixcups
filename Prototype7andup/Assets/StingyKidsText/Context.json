{"inkVersion":21,"root":[["^Apr 10, 2007","\n","^In January, Joshua Bell, a renowned violinist, spent forty-five minutes of his morning busking at L'Enfant Plaza in Washington, DC.","\n","^A recent Washington Post article describes his reception by DC commuters, many of whom walked by without a glance. The article has sparked many interesting observations on the relation between context, meaning and value in art.","\n","^The article speculates that the general disinterest of the passers-by is not due to a failure to appreciate good art but rather that our perception, reception and appreciation of art has much to do with context.","\n","^It's interesting to watch those videos of Bell playing at a metro station and to observe the number of children who hang back for a moment to take in another glance. It made me think of a something a professor recently said to me: \"students learn what they are not supposed to know.\"","\n","^In other words, we learn through the years to discriminate and judge not only the things that surround us, but also our ability and capacity to understand what is unfamiliar.","\n","^A few years ago, a friend asked me to read a poem and tell him if it was any good. He refused to reveal the name of the author. I read the poem in a state of panic. \"I don't know,\" I said. \"I don't know if it's any good.\"","\n","^Without a context, without a way of positioning the author in a critical tradition, I felt completely lost.","\n",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
