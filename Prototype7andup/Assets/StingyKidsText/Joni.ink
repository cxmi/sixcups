I've been listening to Joni Mitchell's Clouds again.  #roman

Some come dark and strange like dying #quote
Crows and ravens whistling #quote
Lines of weeping, strings of crying #quote
So much said in listening #quote

A 1970 profile of Mitchell provides some context for these songs.  My favorite quote: "Grass, it sits you down on your fanny." #roman
